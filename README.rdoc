# Arrive: Texting API
# +1 (954) 356-2027
## Description
Arrive is an app that helps you navigate MIT and surrounding FSILGs by using the SafeRide shuttle system. You tell Arrive where you want to go, and it tells you how to get there.
## API
### Definitions
“Location” is defined as an MIT dormitory or FSILG, and designated as either the official Building number (if on campus) or abbreviated initials. For example, Phi Sigma Kappa is known to the system as PSK.
### Use
To use Arrive, just text the name of your destination to the number above, and Arrive will reply with the route that gets you there the fastest, in addition to replying with the estimated walking time.
For example, if you want to go to Alpha Phi, you would text “AP”.

To use Arrive with a destination AND origin, just type in two locations separated by a comma, with the first being the origin. For example, a text with the body “W20, SK” would get a route from the Student Center to Sigma Kappa.
### Future
I’m currently working on aliases for your favorite living groups. Stay tuned!
